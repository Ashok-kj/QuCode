Understanding vector coordinates is essential in linear algebra, as it allows for a clear 
representation of vectors through scalar multiplication of basis vectors. This concept of 
scaling and adding vectors is foundational for exploring coordinate systems.

Understanding linear combinations of vectors is crucial in linear algebra, as it highlights 
the relationship between vector addition and scalar multiplication in defining vector spaces. 
The span of two vectors determines all reachable vectors in two-dimensional space based on 
these operations.

Span defines the set of all possible linear combinations of vectors. This understanding extends 
from two-dimensional to three-dimensional spaces, illustrating how vectors interact.

P(A/B) = P(B/A) P(A) / P(B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
P(B/A) = P(A/B) P(B) / P(A) = P(B and A) / P(A)
