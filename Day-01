Vectors are essential in linear algebra, defined through three perspectives: 
physics (arrows in space), computer science (ordered lists of numbers), and 
mathematics (abstract operations). Key operations include vector addition 
and scalar multiplication, which allow for translating between geometric 
and numerical representations. Understanding these concepts aids in data 
analysis and spatial manipulation.

Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are essential concepts in linear algebra, 
representing special vectors that remain on their span during transformations. 
They are linked to how matrices act on vectors, with eigenvalues indicating 
the scaling effect. Understanding these concepts enhances comprehension of
linear transformations and facilitates easier computations, especially in 
higher dimensions.
